- **Analytics Integration**: Ready for performance analytics reporting

### 4. Performance Improvements

#### Image Optimization
- **Priority Loading**: First image loads with high priority and eager loading
- **Lazy Loading**: Subsequent images load lazily with low priority
- **Format Support**: Enhanced support for WebP and AVIF formats
- **Responsive Images**: Proper `sizes` attribute for optimal image delivery
- **Preloading Strategy**: Intelligent preloading with `requestIdleCallback`

#### Loading Strategy
- **Critical Path**: Optimized critical rendering path
- **Resource Hints**: Added preload hints for critical resources
- **Bundle Splitting**: Optimized webpack configuration for better caching
- **Compression**: Enabled gzip/brotli compression

#### Runtime Performance
